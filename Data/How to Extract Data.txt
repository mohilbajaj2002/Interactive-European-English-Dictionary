Extracting the data is pretty straightforward. Steps - 
1. Windows users can use apps like BreeZip (available on Microsoft Store for free) and successively unzip the file. Mac/Linux users can use similar unzipping apps. 
2. On reaching the folder that contains *.dict.dz file, first change the extension to .dict.gz using rename (available on right-click) and then extract again. The final file will be in a .dict format which can be opened in a text editor.
